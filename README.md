## Projects:

### LLM Project Intern | Beep, Inc | Lake Nona, FL |August 2023-December 2023

•	Built a customized, cost-effective virtual assistant Chatbot using the open-source LLMA2 model and FAISS database.

•	Engineered prompts for improved and accurate responses.

•	Auto-Generated paraphrased prompts using Pegasus LLM to test robustness.

•	Refactored and added memory to LLM using Lang Chain, reducing the response time from ~19s to ~2s.

### Visual Question Answering using Deep learning | January 2023-May 2023

•	Built CNN, RNN model that performs question answering related to the image content.

•	Trained and fine-tuned the model on DAQUAR dataset.

•	Used Grad -CAM visualization technique to investigate misclassified objects in some images. 

•	Added attention layers leading to increased answers accuracy.

### Water potability prediction | January 2023-May 2023

•	Pre-processed the water properties data and visualize and built predictive models (AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, RF, SVM).

•	Utilized variable selection and dimension reduction techniques to enhance model performance.

•	Fine-tuned the hyperparameters and achieved water potability prediction with classification accuracy of 72%.

### Interactive data visualization of California wildfire | August 2022-December 2022.

•	Created an interactive data visualization dashboard of wildfires in California using Tableau.

•	Implemented filtering capability for user-friendly exploration of relevant statistics.

•	Investigated wildfire occurrence trend and correlation between variables.
